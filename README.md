PropHunt plays much like a Hide and Seek. Players on the RED team, disguised as props, are given a 30 second set up time to hide, and afterwards players on the BLU team attempt to find and kill them in the allotted time period. At the end of each round the teams are swapped; the Hunters (BLU) become the Hunted (RED) and vice versa. Respawns are not permitted until the end of each round.

F.A.Q. 
Q: How do i disguise as a prop?

Q: How do I play a taunt?

Q: How do I play the game? 
A: You need at least one player for team (Props and Hunters). The props (initially with the Dr. Kleiner's skin) need to find a prop in a map and press 'E' to disguise as a prop. The Hunters need to fund props, and kill them. If a hunter shoot at the enemy team, he will gain life, else it will lost life.
